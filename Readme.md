# The MatrixÂ® .NET WinForms screensaver

Written in c# for .Net 4.8 (.Net 4.0 minimum supported). No external components\libs used. No DirectX support, almost no other optimization. Seems like modern PCs can handle it on single core above 3GHz.
My setup is 3 x 2560-1440 @ RTX2070 Super & I7-10700K, and I have about 5% CPU load and 20-50% GPU load.
